# WeatherKit
// Files for my Arduino Uno Weather Kit

This is a kit for a basic weather monitoring station. While this kit is for indoor use only, one could easily find an appropriate weather proof case; and using battiers or solar power with wireless place it outside. This kit is meant as an introduction to the Arduino platform, using sensors, and a door to a fun world. 

This kit includes:

1 x Arduino Uno clone
1 x 25cm micro USB data cable
1 x DHT22 sensor
1 x BMP280 sensor
1 x 5110 84x48 LCD screen
xx x Male to Female Jumper Cables
xx xx Female to female Jumper Cables
2 x 10k resistors - for sensors
1 x 470Ohm resistor - for LCD

Wire the parts as shown / listed below. . .
